# UH Manoa Ride Share

## Overview

UH Manoa Ride Share is a web application designed to address a critical challenge faced by UH Manoa students: the difficulties of campus commuting. With limited, expensive parking and sometimes inconvenient public transportation options, many students resort to driving alone, contributing to increased traffic, higher transportation costs, and elevated carbon emissions.

Our solution connects students who share similar routes and schedules, facilitating an efficient carpooling system that benefits both the community and the environment.

## Goals

- **Reduce Transportation Costs**: Help students save money by sharing commuting expenses
- **Ease Parking Demand**: Decrease the number of single-occupancy vehicles requiring parking on campus
- **Environmental Impact**: Lower carbon emissions by promoting shared rides
- **Community Building**: Foster connections between students through collaborative transportation
- **Enhanced Safety**: Implement features to ensure secure and reliable ride sharing
